Using JDBC in a .NET Core console application for connecting to PostgreSQL and then inserting data into SQL Server, the solution requires managing two database connections: one with PostgreSQL using JDBC and the other with SQL Server using ADO.NET (as JDBC is not natively supported in .NET). However, since .NET Core cannot directly use JDBC (which is Java-based), it is better to use Npgsql for PostgreSQL (a .NET-compatible library) and ADO.NET for SQL Server.

This is a C# example that connects to PostgreSQL using Npgsql (instead of JDBC), retrieves data, and then inserts it into a SQL Server database.
